# Why should I use this?
Because of how easy this is to spin up and/or use, how many links I'm setting up currently, and how it is going to be updated frequently, this will be a great games website (and proxy website lol) 

# FAQ
## How did you make this
I custom made this HTML site, then added games with the [3hk0-assets](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0-Assets) repository. After that, I added on a lot more stuff.
## Is there a tab cloaker?
Yes! It is automatically cloaked as Google however you cannot change it, we're hoping to add that in soon.
## How can I know that someone is you?
My discord ID is currently `810226107248803881`.
## Are there bookmarklets?
Yes, there are now!

# Credit
The proxies are from all around the web, and some are my personal proxies that I host.
The games are from [3hk0](https://github.com/3kh0)'s game assets repository.
I, DiamondBroPlayz am currently the only person working on this. If this changes, then I will update this README.
